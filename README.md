# UrbanTransportationNetworks
This project saves reading notes on the book 'Urban Transportation Networks' by Sheffi (1985).
## A short preface
The flow pattern throughout an urban network can be looked upon as the
result of two competing mechanisms. On the one hand, users of the system
(drivers, passengers, pedestrians) try to travel in a way that minimizes the
disutility associated with transportation. For example, motorists driving between a given origin and a given destination are likely to choose the route
with the shortest travel time. On the other hand, the disutility associated with
travel is not fixed but rather depends in part on the usage of the transportation system. Thus, in the previous example, the travel time on each of the
paths connecting the origin and the destination is a function of the total traffic
flow due to congestion. It is therefore not clear a priori which path through
the network has the shortest travel time. Consequently, it may not be obvious
what the flow pattern throughout the network will be under various conditions. This book describes how this flow pattern can be determined for an
urban road network by modeling these two mechanisms (travel decisions and
congestion).
